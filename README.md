# Glowing Drops
Glowing Drops is a Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.6.  

This mod renders a **beacon-like glowing beam** over every dropped item. Larger stacks get a brighter beam. The color of the beam depends on the rarity of the item.  
Only vanilla rarities have been tested. If you find any compatibilty issues, please report them on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Bluperman949/glowingdrops-mod/issues).  

This mod was inspired by LootBeams for Forge/NeoForge, but is not a port. I am not affiliated with the developers of LootBeams and they did not create this mod. They will not help you with any problems you encounter while using Glowing Drops.
